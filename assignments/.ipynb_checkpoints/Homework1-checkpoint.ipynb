    "## Question 1\n",
    "Implement a class for n-sided polygons and a class for points in a Euclidean system, namely polygon and point respectively. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a 4-sided polygon can be defined by 4 points P1, P2, P3, P4, and P1-P4 are each points of the form point(X,Y), and X and Y are coordinates on the X and Y axis, respectively. \n",
    "\n",
    "The edges are listed counterclockwise starting at the lower left: P1 to P2, P2 to P3, P3 to P4, and P4 to P1. \n",
    "\n",
    "The polygon class should work for polygons of any number of edges and have a function perimeter that returns its perimeter (sum of the lengths of the edges). (20points)\n",
    "\n",
    "Hint: use the Pythagorian theorem: if a line segment Z starts at (X1,Y1) and ends at (X2, Y2), the length of Z is the square root of (X1-X2)^2 + (Y1-Y2)^2.\n",

    "Example: \n",
    "The perimeter of the polygon/triangle on point(1,1), point(1,2), and point(2,2) is 3.4; \n",
    "The perimeter of the 4-sided polygon on point(2,1), point(2,3), point(6,3), and point(4,1) is 10.8; (10points)"
